# Contao NewsMetaDescription

This Contao module enables you to set custom meta description for news items.

## Installation
1. Copy the folder */system/modules/news_metadescription* and all it's contents into *contao_root/system/modules/*
2. Log in to the contao backend
3. Clean the internal caches (*System -> maintenance -> Purge data -> Purge the internal cache*)
4. Update database (*System -> Extension manager -> Update database*)
5. Profit.

## Usage
When editing a news item in the backend, you are now able to set a custom meta description. 
If there’s no custom meta description set, Contao will generate the meta description in the usual way.
